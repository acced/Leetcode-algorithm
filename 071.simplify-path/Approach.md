To simplify a Unix-style file path, you can use a stack to keep track of the directories as you traverse the path. The stack is used to store the simplified version of the path.

1.Split the input path into an array of directories using the "/" character as a separator.

2.Iterate over each directory in the array.

3.If the directory is a single dot (.), ignore it and continue to the next directory.

4.If the directory is two dots (..), pop the last directory from the stack if the stack is not empty.

5.If the directory is any other value, push it onto the stack.

6.After iterating over all the directories, join the directories in the stack using "/" as a separator, and return the result.

If the stack is empty, return "/".
