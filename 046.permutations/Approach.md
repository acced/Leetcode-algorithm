This implementation uses a recursive approach to generate all permutations of the given array nums. The Permute function is the main function that generates the permutations. It calls the helper function PermuteRecursive, which does the actual permutation generation. The PermuteRecursive function uses a backtracking approach to generate the permutations. It swaps the elements at the current position with each of the remaining elements in the array and then recursively generates the permutations for the remaining elements. When the last element is reached, the current permutation is added to the result. After the recursive call returns, the original order of the elements is restored by swapping the elements back.

Note that this implementation modifies the given array nums in-place and returns a list of lists containing the permutations. Each permutation is represented as a list of integers in the same order as in the original array.
