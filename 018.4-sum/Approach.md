# Problem

Given an array of integers nums and a target value target, find four numbers in nums such that they add up to target.

# Difficulties

One difficulty of this problem is that we need to find four numbers in the array that add up to the target value. This means that we need to find a way to efficiently check if a group of four numbers in the array add up to the target value.

 Another difficulty is avoiding duplicate solutions. Since the input array is not necessarily unique, we need to make sure that we do not return the same solution multiple times.

# Algorithms

One way to solve this problem is to first sort the input array. This will allow us to easily check if a group of four numbers adds up to the target value.

Next, we can use three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of four numbers in the array. For each combination, we can check if the sum of the four numbers is equal to the target value. If it is, we can add the combination to the list of solutions.

To avoid returning duplicate solutions, we can skip over combinations of numbers that have the same value as the previous combination.

# Steps

Sort the input array.
Use three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of four numbers in the array.
For each combination, check if the sum of the four numbers is equal to the target value.
If the sum is equal to the target value, add the combination to the list of solutions.
Skip over combinations of numbers that have the same value as the previous combination.

# Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), since we need to iterate over all possible combinations of four numbers in the array.

The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to store the list of solutions and a few temporary variables.
