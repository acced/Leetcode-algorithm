Double pointer method is a common algorithm design technique that can help you quickly locate specific elements or calculate the number of elements that meet certain conditions in arrays or linked lists and other data structures. Its basic idea is to use two pointers to point to specific elements in the sequence of data to be processed, and by continuously moving these two pointers, the specified target can be achieved.

For example, if you want to find all element pairs in an integer array whose sum is a specified value, you can use the double pointer method to solve this problem. First, pointer 1 points to the first element of the array, and pointer 2 points to the last element of the array. Then, by continuously moving these two pointers, each time comparing the sum of the elements pointed to by pointers 1 and 2 with the specified value, if their sum is larger than the specified value, pointer 2 is moved to the left by one position; if their sum is smaller than the specified value, pointer 1 is moved to the right by one position. In this way, you can quickly find all elements that meet the conditions.

The advantage of the double pointer method is that it can calculate the result while processing the data without additional storage.
