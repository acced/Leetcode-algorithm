# Problem:

Next Permutation is a problem in which we are given a permutation of numbers and we need to find the next permutation in lexicographical order.

# Difficulty:

The main difficulty of this problem is to find the next permutation in lexicographical order. This requires us to understand the concept of lexicographical order and the algorithm to find the next permutation.

# Reason for Solving Algorithm:

The algorithm used in this solution is based on the observation that the next permutation can be found by first identifying the largest index k such that nums[k] < nums[k + 1], and then replacing the element at index k with the smallest element from the subarray nums[k + 1:] that is larger than nums[k]. If no such index k exists, the array is already sorted in descending order and we can simply reverse it to get the next permutation.

# Detailed Steps:
1. We start by iterating over the array from right to left and find the largest index k such that nums[k] < nums[k + 1]. If no such index exists, the array is already sorted in descending order and we can simply reverse it to get the next permutation.

2. Once we have found the index k, we find the smallest element in the subarray nums[k + 1:] that is larger than nums[k]. This can be done by iterating over the subarray and keeping track of the smallest element we have seen so far.

3. We then swap the elements at indices k and j, where j is the index of the smallest element we found in step 2.

4. Finally, we reverse the subarray nums[k + 1:] to get the next permutation in lexicographical order.
# Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

# Space Complexity:

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.
