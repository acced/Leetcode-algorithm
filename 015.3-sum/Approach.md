# Problem

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

# Difficulties

Finding all unique triplets that add up to zero in an array can be difficult because there are many possible combinations of three numbers that could be chosen. Additionally, it is important to ensure that each combination is unique, which adds an extra level of complexity to the problem.

# Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. First, we sort the array in ascending order. Then, we iterate through the array, using each element as the first element in a triplet. For each first element, we use two pointers, one at the start of the array and one at the end, to find the other two elements that would make the triplet sum to zero.

# Steps

Sort the array in ascending order.
Iterate through the array, using each element as the first element in a triplet.
Use two pointers, one at the start of the array and one at the end, to find the other two elements that would make the triplet sum to zero.
If the sum of the three elements is zero, add the triplet to the result list.
Continue iterating until all possible triplets have been considered.

# Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) because we iterate through the array once and then use two pointers to iterate through the array again for each element. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few variables to keep track of the pointers
