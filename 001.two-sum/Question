# Question:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target` , return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target` .

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

output = [0, 1]

## Constraints:

* The length of the array will not exceed 10, 000.
* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
* The returned output should be a tuple of indices representing the index of the two numbers that add up to the target in the input array.
* The indices should be zero-based and the tuple should be in the form of (index1, index2), where index1 < index2.
