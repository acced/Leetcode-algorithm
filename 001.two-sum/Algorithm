Algorithm:

Use A hash table
what is Hash table?
In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary. It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.
Using A Dictionary as array's hash table bulid the relationship between array.value and array.key.
Dictionary key:array[j] Dictionary value:j
Judging target-array[i] and array[i].Find return i,j


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n). We traverse the list containing n elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only O(1) time.

Space complexity: O(n). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most nnn elements.
