# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

## Solution Difficulty

The main difficulty in this problem is finding the value that splits the two arrays into two equal-sized (or as close as possible) halves. This value can be found using a binary search on the smaller of the two arrays.

## Key Points and Considerations

* To make the binary search more efficient, we can swap the two arrays so that we are always searching the smaller array.
* To find the value that splits the two arrays into two equal-sized halves, we need to perform a binary search on the first array and adjust the index of the second array accordingly.
* After finding the value that splits the arrays into two equal-sized halves, we need to compare the values on the left and right of this value in both arrays to find the median.

## Algorithm

1. If the length of the first array is greater than the second array, swap them so that we can perform the binary search on the smaller array.
2. Perform a binary search on the first array to find the value that splits the second array into two equal-sized halves (or as close as possible).
3. If the value we found in the first array is greater than the value immediately to its right in the second array, search the right half of the first array and the left half of the second array.
4. If the value we found in the first array is smaller than the value immediately to its left in the second array, search the left half of the first array and the right half of the second array.
5. Otherwise, we have found the value that splits the second array into two equal-sized halves (or as close as possible). Find the median by comparing the values on the left and right of this value in both arrays.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(min(m

## Space complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of additional space to store variables.
