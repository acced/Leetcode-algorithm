# Problem

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

# Difficulties and reasons for solution

The difficulty of this problem lies in finding the optimal strategy for reaching the end of the array with the minimum number of jumps. One possible solution is to keep track of the maximum reachable index at each step and choose the next index to jump to based on this information.

# Detailed steps

The code initializes two variables, needChoose and canReach, to keep track of the next index that needs to be chosen and the maximum reachable index, respectively. It then iterates through the array and checks if the current index plus the value at the current index is greater than the maximum reachable index. If so, it updates the maximum reachable index and checks if it is greater than or equal to the last index of the array. If it is, the function returns the number of steps plus 1 (since we need to make one more step to reach the end of the array).

Next, the code checks if the current index is the next index we need to choose. If it is, it updates the next index we need to choose to the maximum reachable index and increments the number of steps. This continues until the end of the array is reached or we cannot make any more progress. In the end, the function returns the number of steps.

# Time complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the array.

# Space complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1) since we only use constant space.
