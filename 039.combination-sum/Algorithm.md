The problem is called "Combination Sum", and it is a classic problem in computer science. 

The problem is defined as follows:

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, find all unique combinations in candidates 
where the candidate numbers sum to target. 
Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

For example, given the following candidates and target:

candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7]
target = 7

The possible unique combinations are:

[2, 2, 3]
[7]

The goal of this problem is to find all the unique combinations of elements in candidates that sum up to the given target. Note that the numbers in candidates can only be used once in each combination, and that the combinations should be unique.

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive algorithm. The basic idea is to start with the first element in candidates, and try to find a combination of numbers that sum up to target by adding this element and other elements in candidates. If we find such a combination, we add it to the result and continue the search. If we cannot find a combination that sums up to target, we stop the search and return.

In each step of the search, we need to make sure that we don't use the same element more than once in the same combination, and that we only add unique combinations to the result. To achieve this, we can sort the input candidates array, and use a helper function to keep track of the current combination and the elements that have already been used. The helper function can be defined as follows:

The above function takes the following arguments:

'candidates': the input array of distinct integers.
'target': the target integer.
'result': a list to store the unique combinations that sum up to target.
'combination': a list to store the current combination of numbers.
'start': the index of the element in candidates that we are currently considering.

The function first checks if the current target is zero. If it is, it means that we have found a combination that sums up to target, and we can add it to the result. Otherwise, if the target is negative, it means that we have reached an invalid state and we should stop the search.

If the target is neither zero nor negative, we iterate over the remaining elements in candidates, starting from the start index. For each element, we add it to the current combination, and call the helper function recursively with the updated target and combination. After the recursive call returns, we remove the last element from the combination to restore the state before the recursive call.

In the program that I provided above, the time complexity and space complexity are both O(n), where n is the length of the candidates array. This is because the program uses a recursive algorithm, and the depth of the recursion is determined by the length of the candidates array. In the worst case, the recursion depth can reach the length of the candidates array, which means that the time and space complexity are both proportional to the length of the candidates array.

Additionally, the space complexity is also affected by the number of recursive calls. In each recursive call, we create a new list to store the current combination, which means that the space complexity is also proportional to the recursion depth. In the worst case, where the recursion depth is equal to the length of the candidates array, the space complexity is also O(n).

Note that the above time and space complexity are upper bounds, and the actual time and space complexity may be lower depending on the input. For example, if the target value is not reachable using the elements in the candidates array, the recursion will stop early and the time and space complexity will be lower than O(n).
