# Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in ascending order, but has been rotated, and may contain duplicates, search for a target value in the array.

## Difficulty

Searching in a rotated sorted array is a well-known problem, and the solution is typically a modified binary search algorithm. However, this problem is slightly more difficult because the array may contain duplicates, which makes it more difficult to determine which half of the array to search.

## Solution

One approach to solving this problem is to use a binary search algorithm. The algorithm first checks if the midpoint of the search range contains the target value. If so, the algorithm returns true. Otherwise, it checks if the left half of the array is sorted. If the left half is sorted, it checks if the target value is within the sorted left half of the array. If so, it searches only that half of the array. Otherwise, it searches only the unsorted right half of the array. If the left half of the array is not sorted, it checks if the right half is sorted. If the right half is sorted, it checks if the target value is within the sorted right half of the array. If so, it searches only that half of the array. Otherwise, it searches only the unsorted left half of the array. If the left and right halves of the array are not sorted, then the array contains duplicates, and the algorithm simply skips over the duplicates and continues the search. If the target value is not found after the binary search, the algorithm returns false.

## Steps

1. Define a function `Search` that takes an integer array `nums` and an integer `target` as inputs.
    - Initialize two variables `start` and `end` to represent the start and end indices of the search range.
    - Initialize a variable `mid` to represent the midpoint of the search range.
2. Perform a binary search on the array.
    - In each iteration of the binary search, calculate the midpoint of the current search range.
    - If the midpoint of the search range contains the target value, return true.
    - If the left half of the array is sorted, check if the target value is within the sorted left half of the array.
3. If the target value is within the sorted left half of the array, update the search range to only include the left half of the array.
    - Otherwise, update the search range to only include the unsorted right half of the array.
4. If the left half of the array is not sorted, check if the right half is sorted.
    - If the right half of the array is sorted, check if the target value is within the sorted right half of the array.
    - If the target value is within the sorted right half of the array, update the search range to only include the right half of the array.
    - Otherwise, update the search range to only include the unsorted left half of the array.
    - If the right half of the array is not sorted, then the array contains duplicates. In this case, simply skip over the duplicates and continue the search.
5. If the target value is not found after the binary search, return false.

## Time complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the solution uses binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.

## Space complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because it does not use any additional data structures to store the input array. The solution only uses a few variables to store indices and the midpoint of the search range.
