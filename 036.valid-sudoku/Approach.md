# Valid Sudoku

## Problem

Given a 9x9 grid, determine whether the grid is a valid Sudoku puzzle. A Sudoku puzzle is valid if and only if:

* Each of the rows contains exactly one instance of each of the numbers 1 through 9
* Each of the columns contains exactly one instance of each of the numbers 1 through 9
* Each of the 3x3 sub-grids (also called "boxes") contains exactly one instance of each of the numbers 1 through 9

## Difficulty

Solving a Sudoku puzzle is a well-known NP-hard problem, so it is not straightforward to determine if a given grid is a valid Sudoku puzzle. However, checking if a grid is a valid Sudoku puzzle is much easier than actually solving the puzzle.

## Solution

One approach to solving this problem is to iterate through the grid and check each row, column, and box to see if they contain exactly one instance of each of the numbers 1 through 9. If any of these checks fail, then the grid is not a valid Sudoku puzzle.

## Steps

1. Initialize a set to store the numbers 1 through 9.
2. Iterate through the rows of the grid.
3. For each row, iterate through the numbers in the row.
4. If a number is not in the set, return false (the grid is not a valid Sudoku puzzle).
5. If a number is in the set, remove it from the set.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each column and each box.
7. If the function reaches the end without returning false, then the grid is a valid Sudoku puzzle, so return true.

## Time complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid (9 in this case). This is because the algorithm iterates through each row, column, and box in the grid, and each of these operations is an O(n) operation.

## Space complexity

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), because the set used to store the numbers 1 through 9 is a fixed size and does not grow with the input.
